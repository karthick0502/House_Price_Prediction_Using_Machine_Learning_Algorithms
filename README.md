# House Price Prediction Project

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting house prices based on various features such as area type, number of bathrooms, balcony count, square footage range, size, availability, society, and location. Multiple machine learning models are employed to build predictive models and evaluate their performance.

## Technologies Used

The project utilizes the following technologies:

- Python: The primary programming language used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis, including loading datasets, handling missing values, and encoding categorical features.
- Scikit-learn: A machine learning library in Python used for implementing various algorithms for regression tasks, including RandomForestRegressor, Support Vector Machine (SVM) Regression, and Gradient Boosting Regression.
- Matplotlib: For data visualization, including plotting graphs and visualizing model predictions.

## Machine Learning Models

The project employs the following machine learning models for predicting house prices:

1. RandomForestRegressor: A type of ensemble learning method based on decision trees, used for building multiple decision trees and averaging their predictions to improve accuracy.
2. Support Vector Machine (SVM) Regression: A supervised learning algorithm used for regression tasks, aiming to fit as many instances as possible within a margin while minimizing violations of that margin.
3. Gradient Boosting Regression: A machine learning technique for regression tasks that builds models in a stage-wise manner, combining multiple weak learners (typically decision trees) to create a strong predictive model.

## Conclusion

The project explores different machine learning models to predict house prices based on various features. By leveraging the power of ensemble methods, kernel-based algorithms, and boosting techniques, it aims to provide accurate predictions for real estate prices. Contributions and feedback are welcome to further enhance the project's performance and applicability.
